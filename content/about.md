My name's Austin Pocus (like "hocus pocus"), and I've been writing web software profesionally for over a decade. In between, I've attempted some pretty weird stuff, like:

- Reading and analyzing the sound waves from my guitar
- Making a toolkit for building your own old-school RPG
- Designing and building my own programming languages

Here, I'm hoping to record some of the processes behind projects like these and others. Stay tuned for improvements to the site and upcoming posts!
