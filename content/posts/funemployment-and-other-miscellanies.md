If you haven't seen it on LinkedIn by now, I am currently in "funemployment", which is just a nice way of saying I left my job.

So, if you know anyone who needs a full stack developer, focused on the web with nearly a decade of experience, with a generous measure of gumption and empathy, and a helpful, can-do attitude: shoot me a message! My email is my first name at [pocuslabs.com](https://pocuslabs.com).

There are a few companies I'm talking to right now, I've received a couple of rejections, but for the most part my hunt for a new position has been overtaken by health issues. I can discuss this in private, but it's just that: private.

So if all this is private, why am I writing this _at all_?

My writing volume seemed to take a sharp decline in the new year, and I'd like to get back on track. Besides, writing is cathartic, right?

Aside from that, I'd like to at least offer some minimal explanation of why I haven't been writing as much lately. I was writing multiple posts per day at one point. This illness put a damper on that sort of output.

Mostly I've been resting up, healing, but I've also been participating heavily in [discussions on makers.v1labs.com](https://makers.v1labs.com). So far, it's just a few people, and most conversations are between myself and [Dane of v1Labs](https://v1labs.com), but we're hoping to build a community here, together. It's going to grow organically, though -- we're not trying to push people to participate on a platform they aren't passionate about.

Rather, whoever finds it naturally via google (or this blog) can sign up and participate, or they're free to just browse the conversations. This way, we get participants who have a sincere interest in the topics at hand.

With many of my thought-dump-style rants going on [makers.v1labs.com](https://makers.v1labs.com), this is probably going to be more of a personal journal than anything. Thoughts, rants, talking about certain aspects of projects...anything that doesn't fit on the v1 Makers forum, I'll post here.

For now, I'm going to get back to work on Graffitoes, the collaborative wall of art on the web.

Til next time (hopefully sooner rather than later), this is Austin reminding you to take care of yourself! I leave you with a fitting song about health and wellness (NSFW):
